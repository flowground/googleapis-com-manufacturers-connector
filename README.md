### Inserts or updates the attributes of the product in a Manufacturer Center<br/>
> account.<br/>
> <br/>
> Creates a product with the provided attributes. If the product already<br/>
> exists, then all attributes are replaced with the new ones. The checks at<br/>
> upload time are minimal. All required attributes need to be present for a<br/>
> product to be valid. Issues may show up later after the API has accepted a<br/>
> new upload for a product and it is possible to overwrite an existing valid<br/>
> product with an invalid product. To detect this, you should retrieve the<br/>
> product and check it for issues once the new version is available.<br/>
> <br/>
> Uploaded attributes first need to be processed before they can be<br/>
> retrieved. Until then, new products will be unavailable, and retrieval<br/>
> of previously uploaded products will return the original state of the<br/>
> product.
